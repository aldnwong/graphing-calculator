# Graphing Calculator
![GIF](https://github.com/aldnwong/graphing-calculator/blob/main/calc.gif?raw=true)

This is a graphing calculator written in C++ that utilizes the SFML library. It was made as a final project for my Fundamentals of Computer Science II (C++) course in the spring of 2025.

It is able to graph a single function with navigation similar to that of Desmos. It supports the following functions:
- Trig functions (cos, sin, tan, etc)
- max and min
- sqrt
- e, ln, and log
- Radians/degree toggle
- RGB for fun

There's a lot I would change about this project if I were to do it again, but for my first time using SFML and not having a ton of C++ experience, it turned out well.
Unfortunately, the commit history for this project is unavailable as I had to redact some sensitive information within the project files.
Polar graphing also was not made in time for the project due date.
